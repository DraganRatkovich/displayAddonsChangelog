# Display addons Changelog  

This is a proposed solution for [issue#14041](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/14041). Shows the change log for an addon when it is updated, during the installation process.  

It has been implemented as an addon to be evaluated and tested. Collaborations and improvement proposals are welcome.  

Addon developers only need to include a file called changelog.txt with this information. It is advisable that the file be encoded in UTF-8 and that it is not too long to be viewed in a dialog. There may be translations of the changelog.txt file in their corresponding folders; The one corresponding to the language of NVDA will be displayed.
